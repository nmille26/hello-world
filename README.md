# hello-world
So I've coded before but I'm following the tutorial. Fun!


Who am I? I guess I'm so many things and so many people. But mainly I'm HERE to study economic models. 

GitHub is asking for a lot of commitment that, frankly, I'm not certain I'm ready to give. Perhaps I can commit in the future.
